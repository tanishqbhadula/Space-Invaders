# Space Invaders (Java)

A simple Space Invaders clone built in Java using Swing and Java2D.  
This project was created to explore basic game development concepts like game loops, keyboard input, sprite movement, and collision detection.

## Features
- Player movement and shooting
- Alien group movement
- Bullet-alien collision
- Basic scoring and game over logic

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open in IntelliJ or any Java IDE
3. Run `Main.java`

No external libraries needed â€” just Java SE.

*This project will later be re-themed into a Wild West version with new art, sound, and features.*
